# Introduce

## Recycle UI

Concis is a lightweight React UI component library that supports multiple modules. It focuses on supporting the introduction of various personalized components outside of traditional components, and is mainly used to develop enterprise level middle and back office products.

## Characteristics

- 🌈 The interactive language and visual style extracted from enterprise level middle and back office products.

- 📦 High quality React components out of the box.

- 🛡 Developed using TypeScript to provide a complete type definition file.

- ⚙️ Full link development and design tool system.

- 🌍 Dozens of international languages are supported.

- 🎨 The ability to customize topics in depth for each detail.

- 💡 Vscode code hint highlighting support.

- 💪 Ensure more than 90% unit test coverage and provide stability assurance

## Compatible environment

- Modern browsers and IE11 (polyfills required).

- Support server rendering.

- React-Native。

For IE series browsers, you need to provide corresponding Polyfill support. It is recommended to use @ babel/preset env to solve the browser compatibility problem. If you are using umi, you can directly use the targets configuration.

## Multi module support

Concis supports three modules: `cjs`、`ejs`、`umd`. It customizes your Web running environment. Concis is written in `TypeScript`. You can enjoy intelligent prompts during use.
